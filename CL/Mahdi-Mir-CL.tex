My name's Mahdi; I have an excellent experience with Python, working with
databases, deep learning models, image processing, statistical analyses,
and almost all sorts of things in Python.

\par

Recently, I graduated with a Master's in Theoretical Economics from TeIAS (Tehran
Institute for Advanced Studies, the leading economic/financial research institute
in Iran). I've been researching Economics \&
also doing RA jobs at TeIAS for the last three years. I have been the RA of Mahdi Heidari for almost 30 months, also I've done RA jobs
with Hamed Davari from the university of Mannheim, Germany, for 4 months, moreover, I have an ongoing RA job with Javad Shamsi from LSE, UK.
\\
Before my Maser's in Economics, I graduated from the Electrical Engineering Department
of Sharif university of technology, which is a renowned department worldwide.
I enhanced my mathematical \& quantitative skills during these years.

\par

I have done so many projects in Python, Julia, Stata, R and some other programming
languages during my years in Master's of economics, especially, I extracted
share-holding data from Iranian mutual funds’ reports’ images, which is
brave new nationwide.
I used image processing methods, the TableNet deep learning model with some adjustments,
and the Google Tesseract engine for this job.
I currently have a job offer in hand from the Agah brokerage's quantitative branch
to extend this work to other sorts of financial/economic data. In Iran, most of
the accurate data are jailed in reports and printed tables that are never
digitilized systematically. Also, Agah is the second-largest brokerage in the
country; and they have acknowledged my work and offered me without my application
for the job. But I prefer to continue my academic path.

\par


I believe that my previous quantitative \& mathematical skills,
as well as my excellence in programming with Python,
makes me the right candidate for the predoctoral position.


I love learning, researching \& coding, especially in the area of economics.
I hope to work on research projects to strengthen
my skills \& deepen my knowledge so I can develop my research agenda and apply
for a Ph.D. in economics at an excellent university.

Please review my CV for additional details regarding my expertise and
achievements. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further
clarification on my experience. I would love to meet with you and discuss the position in
detail.
